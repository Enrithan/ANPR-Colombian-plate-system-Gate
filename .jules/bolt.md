## 2024-05-24 - Speed up EasyOCR inference with allowlist
**Learning:** EasyOCR inference can be significantly accelerated and memory footprint reduced by providing an `allowlist` of expected characters when the domain is known (e.g., license plates only contain `A-Z` and `0-9`). This prunes the search space of the recognizer model.
**Action:** Always restrict OCR character sets using `allowlist` when the expected format is strictly defined.

## 2024-05-25 - Optimize Image Perspective Transformations
**Learning:** Applying geometric transformations like `cv2.warpPerspective` on a 3-channel (BGR) image takes roughly 3x longer than doing it on a single-channel (grayscale) image. Since the OCR pipeline converts to grayscale right after anyway, warping the BGR image was a pure waste of interpolation resources.
**Action:** Always convert to single-channel (grayscale) *before* applying computationally expensive spatial transformations (like warp, rotate, or scale) if the subsequent processing step only requires single-channel data.

## 2025-03-21 - Precomputing Data Structures & Regular Expressions
**Learning:** Initializing variables, casting datatypes (lists/dicts), parsing `string` constants and iterating inside `for` loops within very fast execution pathways (like plate validation per frame) has an enormous cumulative performance cost (0.22s to 0.04s or 4x difference). Pre-compiling one combined regex (`|`) is similarly 4x faster than looping over a list of independent compiled expressions.
**Action:** Move instantiation of objects, lists, sets, and constants out of tight loops. Use module-level variables with O(1) set-lookups and combine regular expressions where possible to skip Python iteration overhead.

## 2025-03-21 - YOLO Bounding Box Vectorized Extraction
**Learning:** Accessing YOLO detection properties (like `box.xyxy[0]` or `box.conf[0]`) individually inside a loop causes repeated, synchronous GPU-CPU data transfers, significantly slowing down the detection pipeline.
**Action:** Always extract bounding box data entirely at once using vectorized tensor operations (e.g., `results.boxes.data.cpu().numpy()`) and then iterate over the resulting NumPy array. Also, use native Python sets for class lookups instead of lists to further optimize the loop. Remember to cast extracted values back to native Python types (`float`, `int`) to avoid serialization bugs downstream.
