## 2024-05-24 - Speed up EasyOCR inference with allowlist
**Learning:** EasyOCR inference can be significantly accelerated and memory footprint reduced by providing an `allowlist` of expected characters when the domain is known (e.g., license plates only contain `A-Z` and `0-9`). This prunes the search space of the recognizer model.
**Action:** Always restrict OCR character sets using `allowlist` when the expected format is strictly defined.

## 2024-05-25 - Optimize Image Perspective Transformations
**Learning:** Applying geometric transformations like `cv2.warpPerspective` on a 3-channel (BGR) image takes roughly 3x longer than doing it on a single-channel (grayscale) image. Since the OCR pipeline converts to grayscale right after anyway, warping the BGR image was a pure waste of interpolation resources.
**Action:** Always convert to single-channel (grayscale) *before* applying computationally expensive spatial transformations (like warp, rotate, or scale) if the subsequent processing step only requires single-channel data.

## 2025-03-21 - Precomputing Data Structures & Regular Expressions
**Learning:** Initializing variables, casting datatypes (lists/dicts), parsing `string` constants and iterating inside `for` loops within very fast execution pathways (like plate validation per frame) has an enormous cumulative performance cost (0.22s to 0.04s or 4x difference). Pre-compiling one combined regex (`|`) is similarly 4x faster than looping over a list of independent compiled expressions.
**Action:** Move instantiation of objects, lists, sets, and constants out of tight loops. Use module-level variables with O(1) set-lookups and combine regular expressions where possible to skip Python iteration overhead.

## 2025-03-22 - Caching Static NumPy Arrays in CV Loops
**Learning:** Instantiating static NumPy arrays (e.g., perspective transform coordinate matrices or convolution kernels) inside high-frequency computer vision paths introduces severe allocation overhead. For example, moving array creation out of an OCR frame loop can drop execution time from 0.51s to 0.005s per 100k calls. OpenCV functions like `cv2.getPerspectiveTransform` and `cv2.filter2D` do not mutate their arguments.
**Action:** Always pre-compute and cache static configuration arrays as module-level constants to avoid instantiation overhead inside loops.
